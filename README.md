<h3>COVID-19 patient X-ray image dataset</h3>
</strong></p>In this repo we are going to detect COVID19 from X-ray images. The dataset is publicly available at [pyimagesearch.com](https://pyimagesearch.com/2020/03/16/detecting-covid-19-in-x-ray-images-with-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/). The COVID-19 X-ray image dataset we’ll be using for this code was created by Dr. Joseph Cohen. He collected X-ray images of COVID-19 cases and published them in the [following GitHub repo](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset). We'll be using 25 infected lung X-ray from that source that Adrian Rosebrock has done some sort of steps in order to create the COVID-19 X-ray image dataset. As the healthy lung X-ray sample, Adrian Rosebrock has sampled 25 X-ray images from healthy patients from [Kaggle’s Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
