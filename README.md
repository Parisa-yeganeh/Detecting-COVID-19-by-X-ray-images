In this repo we are going to detect COVID19 from X-ray images. We'll be using 25 infected lung X-ray and 25 healthy lung X-ray images. The dataset is publicly available at [pyimagesearch.com](https://pyimagesearch.com/2020/03/16/detecting-covid-19-in-x-ray-images-with-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/).
The COVID-19 X-ray image dataset weâ€™ll be using for this code was curated by Dr. Joseph Cohen. He collected X-ray images of COVID-19 cases and published them in the [following GitHub repo](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset).
